* Cleaned code
	* Switched to condensed if/while statements
	* Using 'if ! statement' rather than passing
	* Timeout as function
	* Repeated variables predefined
	* Formatting corrections as function
	* Consistent multiline echo format
	* Cleaner markdown

* Removed smart reversion
	Smart reversion was initially introduced to make up
	for gaps in my bash knowledge. Now I have a better
	command of the language the new way thing are fixed
	means it doens't matter if a launcher is fixed multiple
	times.

* Removed local storage
	We no longer utilise a data direcotry stored on the
	local computer. I made this decision while refactoring
	the fixing code and noticed that parts of the script
	required internet access but downloaded other files
	wither the logic that it would be good to have them
	stored offline.

* Steamlined updating
	* fix.sh doesn't require a seperate file containing the date
	* app list doens't require a seperate file containing the date
	* Removed automatic fix.sh updating
		Because this script is packaged in the AUR, the bpkg, and
		potentially elsewhere in future having an internal update
		mechanism will only confuse things.

* Better error handling
	* Function for error + timeout (gerror)
	* No longer removes data dir if error occurs
