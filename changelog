* Cleaned code
	* Switched to condensed if/while statements
	* Using 'if ! statement' rather than passing
	* Timeout as function
	* Formatting corrections as function
	* Consistent multiline echo format
	* Cleaner markdown

* Steamlined updating
	* fix.sh doesn't require a seperate file containing the date
	* app list doens't require a seperate file containing the date
	* Removed automatic fix.sh updating
		Because this script is packaged in the AUR, the bpkg, and
		potentially elsewhere in future having an internal update
		mechanism will only confuse things.

* Better error handling
	* Function for error + timeout (gerror)
	* No longer removes data dir if error occurs
